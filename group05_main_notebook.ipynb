    "**Base Feature Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are foundational features derived directly from the original data, often to create linear relationships or capture interactions.\n",
    "- `age`: Calculated as `2020 - year`. Creates a simple linear feature representing the car's age. Newer cars (lower age) generally have higher prices.\n",
    "- `miles_per_year`: Calculated as `mileage / age`. This normalizes the car's usage, preventing high correlation (multicollinearity) between `mileage` and `age`. A 3-year-old car with 60,000 miles is different from a 6-year-old car with 60,000 miles.\n",
    "- `age_x_engine`: An interaction term `age * engineSize`. This helps the model capture non-linear relationships, such as the possibility that the value of cars with large engines might depreciate faster (or slower) than cars with small engines.\n",
    "- `mpg_x_engine`: An interaction term `mpg * engineSize`. This captures the combined effect of fuel efficiency and engine power.\n",
    "- `tax_per_engine`: Calculated as `tax / engineSize`. This feature represents the tax cost relative to the engine's power, which could be an indicator of overall running costs or vehicle class.\n",
    "- `mpg_per_engine`: Calculated as `mpg / engineSize`. This creates an \"efficiency\" metric, representing how many miles per gallon the car achieves for each unit of engine size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Popularity & Demand Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "These features attempt to quantify a car's popularity or market demand, which directly influences price.\n",
    "- `model_freq`: Calculates the frequency (percentage) of each `model` in the training dataset. Popular, common models often have more stable and predictable pricing and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Price Anchor Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "These features \"anchor\" a car's price relative to its group. They provide a strong baseline price signal based on brand, model, and configuration.\n",
    "- `brand_med_price`: The median price for the car's `Brand` (e.g., the typical price for a BMW vs. a Skoda). This captures overall brand positioning.\n",
    "- `model_med_price`: The median price for the car's `model` (e.g., the typical price for a 3-Series vs. a 1-Series). This captures the model's positioning within the brand.\n",
    "- `brand_fuel_med_price`: The median price for the car's specific `Brand` and `fuelType` combination (e.g., a Diesel BMW vs. a Petrol BMW).\n",
    "- `brand_trans_med_price`: The median price for the `Brand` and `transmission` combination (e.g., an Automatic BMW vs. a Manual BMW).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalized & Relative Features**\n",
    "\n",
    "These features compare a car to its peers rather than using absolute values.\n",
    "- `*_anchor` (e.g., `brand_med_price_anchor`): Created by dividing the median price features (from section 3) by the `overall_mean_price`. This makes the feature dimensionless and represents the group's price *relative* to the entire market (e.g., \"this brand is 1.5x the market average\").\n",
    "- `age_rel_brand`: Calculated as `age - brand_median_age`. This shows if a car is newer or older than the *typical* car for that specific brand, capturing relative age within its own group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**CV-Safe Target Encodings**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an advanced technique to encode categorical variables (like `model` or `Brand`) using information from the target variable (`price`) without causing data leakage.\n",
    "- `*_te` (e.g., `model_te`): Represents the *average price* for that category (e.g., the average price for a \"Fiesta\").\n",
    "- **Why is it \"CV-Safe\"?** Instead of just calculating the global average price for \"Fiesta\" and applying it to all rows (which leaks target information), this method uses K-Fold cross-validation. For each fold of the data, the target encoding is calculated *only* from the *other* folds. This ensures the encoding for any given row never includes its own price, preventing leakage and leading to a more robust model."
