    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cars4You project aims to accelerate and standardize used-car price evaluations by replacing manual, subjective pricing with a production-ready machine learning pipeline. Our objective was to optimize predictive accuracy (MAE) on unseen cars while ensuring robustness to wrong inputs and a leakage-free evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our EDA containing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis showed three dominant challenges: (1) inconsistent raw entries (typos, invalid ranges, sparse categories), (2) strong segmentation effects by brand/model, and (3) heavy-tailed numeric distributions (notably mileage). \n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed these with a custom engineered and reproducible sklearn pipeline. It follows the state of the art pipeline architecture and consists the following transformers: \n",
    "\n",
    "deterministic cleaning and category canonicalization with `CarDataCleaner` and hierarchical imputation with `IndividualHierarchyImputer`. We then added domain-informed feature engineering with `CarFeatureEngineer` to encode depreciation, usage intensity, efficiency/performance ratios, interaction effects, and relative positioning within brand/model segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding and scaling were consolidated in a `ColumnTransformer` combining selective log transforms, `RobustScaler`, one-hot encoding, and median target encoding for high-signal categorical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce noise and improve generalization, we implemented automated feature selection as a dedicated pipeline stage: VarianceThreshold followed by majority voting across complementary selectors (Spearman relevance+redundancy, mutual information, and tree-based importance). SHAP was used strictly for interpretability and diagnostics in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "All model selection and tuning followed a consistent 5-fold cross-validation protocol. Primary evaluation metric MAE was set at the beginning of the project, we also evaluated RMSE and R2. After a first run of different models on original and engineered features, further hyperparameter tuning on the tree-based models HistGradientBoost and RandomForest was decided. The final tuned RF pipeline improved substantially over a naive median baseline (MAE ≈ 6.8k), achieving approximately **£1.2k MAE** in cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed methodological reasoning, trade-offs and further findings please refer to the respective sections."

    "#### I. Identifying Business Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context**       \n",
    "Cars 4 You is an online car-resale company that buys cars from many brands. Sellers submit car details online, and the company traditionally relies on a mechanic inspection before making a purchase offer. Company growth has increased waiting lists for inspections, which risks losing potential customers to competitors. The business need is therefore to **expedite pricing** by generating a reliable **pre-inspection price estimate** directly from user-provided inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main goals**     \n",
    "**Business goal:** provide a fast, consistent price estimate at intake to reduce inspection bottlenecks and improve conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML goal:** train a supervised **regression** model to predict `price` (GBP) from features available at form submission time. Because `paintQuality%` is filled by a mechanic during evaluation, it is treated as **non-production** input and is excluded from the deployed prediction path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall process (end-to-end)**      \n",
    "1. **Data intake:** use the 2020 training dataset (features + target `price`) to develop and validate models; use the provided test dataset (features only) for final predictions and Kaggle submission.\n",
    "2. **EDA → preprocessing decisions:** identify data inconsistencies, missingness patterns, segmentation by brand/model, and heavy-tailed variables; translate insights into pipeline steps.\n",
    "3. **Leakage-safe pipeline:** implement cleaning, outlier handling, hierarchical imputation, feature engineering, encoding/scaling, and feature selection as sklearn transformers inside a single `Pipeline` so that every step is fitted only on training folds.\n",
    "4. **Model benchmarking & optimization:** compare candidate regressors on a consistent protocol; tune the most promising models; select the most generalizable pipeline based on validation performance.\n",
    "5. **Deployment output:** fit the selected pipeline on the full training set and generate predictions for `test.csv` to produce the final submission `.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model assessment strategy:**     \n",
    "We adopt **5-fold cross-validation (CV)** on the training set as the single assessment strategy used throughout benchmarking and tuning. The primary metric is **MAE** (business-interpretable error in GBP), with RMSE and R² reported as complementary diagnostics. The Kaggle test set functions as an **external holdout** for the final chosen pipeline (labels hidden; performance observed via leaderboard score).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on the respective steps in the pipeline, refer to the specific part in the notebook below."

    " \n",
    "Both outperform the next tier (HGB and KNN), and they do so with very small fold-to-fold variability, indicating that the gain is not driven by a subset of “lucky” splits.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **HGB/KNN** improve with preprocessing but remain worse than ET/RF, consistent with residual bias (HGB) or limited representational flexibility (KNN).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **MLP (optimized)** is unstable: despite a moderate MAE, the **RMSE explodes** and **R² becomes strongly negative**, which is characteristic of rare but extremely large errors (tail instability), making it unsuitable in this configuration.\n",
    " \n",
    "---\n",
    " \n",
    "**2) Effect size of preprocessing (optimized vs original)**\n",

    "The optimized preprocessing delivers a large, consistent improvement for the models that can exploit nonlinear interactions:\n",

In other words, ET is well-matched to structured tabular data with mixed numeric/categorical signals and non-additive effects.\n",

    " \n",
    "- **ET/RF optimized** show materially lower training error than validation error (ET train MAE ≈ 446 vs val MAE ≈ 1234; RF train MAE ≈ 674 vs val MAE ≈ 1236). This indicates high capacity and some degree of overfitting, which is expected for ensembles. Crucially, this does **not** translate into unstable validation results: fold variability is low, suggesting the models generalize reliably despite the gap.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **HGB optimized** has relatively close train/val errors (train MAE ≈ 1359 vs val MAE ≈ 1406), consistent with a more bias-limited model: it generalizes more “smoothly” but cannot reach the same accuracy ceiling as ET/RF.\n",
    " \n",
    "- **MLP optimized** exhibits a clear robustness failure: the huge RMSE and negative R² indicate that a minority of cases are predicted extremely poorly. This is not merely “worse average performance”; it is a qualitatively different error profile (high-risk tail behaviour).\n",
    " \n",
    "A notable anomaly appears for **ET_orig**: the reported **train MAE ≈ 4** and **train RMSE ≈ 89** are extraordinarily small compared to all other models and configurations. Given that validation performance is far from perfect, such near-zero training error suggests either extreme memorization and/or an artefact in how training metrics were computed in that configuration. In contrast, ET under optimized preprocessing yields plausible training metrics while also improving validation performance, which strengthens the credibility of the optimized pipeline as the final modelling choice.\n",

    "The results support a clear empirical conclusion:\n",

    "\n",
    "After building a strong pipeline (data cleaning → imputation → feature engineering → encoding/scaling → VT + majority-vote FS → tuned tree model), we use **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** purely for **interpretability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    "- Identify the **most influential features** for our final tuned tree model (`hgb_tuned_pipe`).\n",
    "- Validate whether feature effects are **plausible** (age, mileage, engine, etc.).\n",
    "- Understand whether **target encodings** dominate and how engineered interactions contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: **SHAP does not change the model or feature set.** We do not build a new pipeline based on SHAP.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b) Difficulty of the task (1v)\n",
    "\n",
    "This was non-trivial because SHAP must explain the model input **after** our preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The model does not see raw columns. It sees:\n",
    "  - engineered features,\n",
    "  - OHE columns,\n",
    "  - median target-encoded columns,\n",
    "  - and the reduced subset after **VT + majority voting**.\n",
    "- We therefore implemented a helper to reconstruct:\n",
    "  - the exact **post-preprocess feature matrix**, and\n",
    "  - aligned **feature names** after applying both selection masks (VT support + majority selector mask).\n",
    "- For `HistGradientBoostingRegressor`, SHAP’s **additivity check** can fail even with correct shapes. We handle this safely by disabling it (`check_additivity=False`) and keeping a robust fallback explainer if needed.\n",
    "- Runtime: SHAP is expensive, so we compute explanations on a **subsample** (`sample_size=1000`) plus a small background set.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### c) Correctness and efficiency (1v)\n",
    "\n",
    "We kept the analysis correct and consistent with the production pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **No leakage / no optimization loop:** SHAP is computed on the already fitted tuned model and used only to interpret it.\n",
    "- **Exact alignment:** feature names are derived from the ColumnTransformer output and then filtered by VT + majority voting masks.\n",
    "- **Global SHAP importance:** we rank features by mean absolute contribution:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Importance(feature_j) = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N} |SHAP_{i,j}|\n",

    "| `cat__transmission_Manual` | 406.37 | Manual transmission effect |\n",
    "\n",
    "Key takeaways:\n",
    "- **Target encodings dominate** global importance, especially the model-level encoding. This is expected because model identity carries a large fraction of price signal.\n",
    "- **Engineered interactions matter** (`mpg_x_age`, `engine_per_mpg`, `mpg_x_engine`), confirming that our feature engineering adds useful non-additive structure.\n",
    "- **Mileage and age appear in strong, intuitive forms** (log mileage, relative age vs model/brand), supporting both predictive performance and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beeswarm plot (distribution of effects):\n",
    "- **`median_te__model_median_te` dominates** and shows a wide SHAP spread → model identity (via median target encoding) is the strongest pricing signal.\n",
    "- **Mileage effect is non-linear** (`log__mileage`): low mileage produces strong positive contributions; high mileage pushes predictions down, but with diminishing marginal impact (consistent with log-transform).\n",
    "- **Engine/performance features matter across many cars** (`num__engineSize`, `num__engine_per_mpg`, `num__mpg_x_age`) and show heterogeneous spreads → effects differ by segment (e.g., sporty vs economy cars).\n",
    "- **Relative positioning features stabilize predictions** (`num__age_rel_model`, `num__engine_rel_model`): the model compares a car to what is “typical” within its model/segment, not only absolute values.\n",
    "- **Transmission signal is consistent** (`cat__transmission_Manual`): manual cars tend to shift predictions in one direction (dataset-dependent), but the spread indicates exceptions (model/brand interactions).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##### e) Alignment with objectives (0.5v)\n",
    "\n",
    "This section adds transparency without changing the modeling procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature selection stays **VT + majority voting** (robust, leakage-safe, model-agnostic).\n",
    "- SHAP is used **only** to explain the final tuned model.\n",
    "- The resulting drivers (target encodings + age/mileage/engine + interactions) are consistent with domain logic and support trust in the final pipeline.\n",

    "Extending the existing solution to this multi-level comparison was non-trivial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex pipeline with a custom SHAP selector**  \n",
    "  The final pipeline contains a `ShapTopKColumnSelector` that is not clone-compatible. Standard `cross_val_score` + `clone` would fail. We therefore implemented manual cross-validation:\n",
    "  - reuse the fitted preprocessing + SHAP selector from `hgb_final_shap_pipe`;\n",

    "- **For many common volume models, gains are small or negative.**  \n",
    "  VW Golf, Ford Fiesta, Opel Corsa, Toyota Yaris, etc. often show small positive ΔMAE and/or higher RMSE. For these, splitting by model does not significantly improve typical error and can worsen extreme cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **For rare, high-priced models, model-specific fits severely overfit.**  \n",
    "  BMW 7 series, BMW X6, Mercedes GLS/S/SL/CLS class, VW Beetle, Toyota Avensis/Verso and others exhibit very large increases in MAE (hundreds to thousands of GBP) and often huge increases in RMSE.  \n",
    "  These models have small sample sizes (often <100 cars), so a separate model per (brand, model) is clearly not robust.\n",

    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving from **global → brand** is often beneficial and relatively safe for high-volume brands.\n",

    "- Provides a **clear design recommendation**:\n",

    "  - Optionally introduce **brand-level specialization** for a small set of high-volume brands (e.g. Ford, BMW, Mercedes) where MAE improvements are meaningful.\n",
    "  - Avoid full **brand–model specialization** except potentially for a handful of very frequent models with demonstrated gains; for most models, especially rare and expensive ones, splitting further clearly overfits.\n",
