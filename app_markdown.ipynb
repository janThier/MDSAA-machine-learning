    "The objective of this web application is to provide an accessible, user-friendly interface for predicting used car prices based on our best machine learning model. This deployment serves as the practical implementation component of the Open End Section, transforming our trained model into a production-ready tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**\n",
    "- **Accessibility**: Make the ML model accessible to non-technical users through an intuitive web interface\n",
    "- **User Experience**: Provide instant price predictions with intervals to help users make informed decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target Users**\n",
    "- Used car buyers seeking fair price estimates\n",
    "- Car dealers looking for market-competitive pricing\n",

    "#### b.) Difficulty of Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Model Size Management (High Difficulty)\n",
    "- **Challenge**: The trained model file (`rf_tuned_pipe.pkl`) was 900 mb, far exceeding GitHub's 100 MB limit\n",
    "- **Solution**: Implemented Git Large File Storage (LFS) to handle the massive model file\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Required understanding of Git LFS, bandwidth limitations, and deployment constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dynamic Feature Engineering (Medium Difficulty)\n",
    "- **Challenge**: The model uses custom preprocessing functions from `pipeline_functions.py`\n",
    "- **Solution**: Ensured all custom transformers and functions are properly included in the repository\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Maintaining consistency between training pipeline and deployment environment\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Brand-Model Dependency Mapping (Medium-Low Difficulty)\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Creating a user-friendly interface where model selection dynamically updates based on brand choice\n",
    "- **Solution**: Implemented a nested dictionary structure with 9 brands and 114 models\n",
    "- **Complexity**: Balancing comprehensive coverage with UI simplicity\n",

    "**Accurate Prediction Pipeline**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Performance Optimizations**\n",
    "- `@st.cache_resource` decorator caches the model in memory (loads only once)\n",

    "\n",
    "This web application successfully bridges the gap between ML model development and real-world deployment. Despite technical challenges, the implementation achieves its core objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Accessible**: Anyone can use the tool without ML knowledge  \n",
    "- **Accurate**: MAE of £1,200 provides actionable price estimates  \n",
    "- **Efficient**: Cached model and optimized code ensure fast predictions  \n",
    "\n",
    "The deployment demonstrates practical ML engineering skills including version control (Git LFS), dependency management, cloud deployment (Streamlit Cloud), and user-centric design.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this tool has important limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brand Bias**: Performance is strongest on well-represented brands while predictions for underrepresented manufacturers may be less reliable\n",
    "- **Temporal Relevance**: The model was trained on data up to 2020 and may not fully capture recent market dynamics such as semiconductor shortages or accelerated EV adoption\n",
    "- **Edge Cases**: Predictions for rare models, unusual configurations, or vehicles at price extremes should be treated with additional caution"
