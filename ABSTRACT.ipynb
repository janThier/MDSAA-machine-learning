    "## Group 05: Abstract Cars4You\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cars4You project aims to accelerate and standardize used-car price evaluations by replacing manual, subjective pricing with a production-ready machine learning pipeline. Our objective was to maximize predictive accuracy (MAE) on unseen cars while ensuring robustness to wrong inputs and a leakage-free evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our EDA containing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis showed three dominant challenges: (1) inconsistent raw entries (typos, invalid ranges, sparse categories), (2) strong segmentation effects by brand/model, and (3) heavy-tailed numeric distributions (notably mileage). \n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed these with a custom engineered and reproducible sklearn pipeline. It follows the state of the art pipeline archtecture and consists the following transformers: \n",
    "\n",
    "deterministic cleaning and category canonicalization with `CarDataCleaner`, leakage-safe outlier handling via winsorization with `OutlierHandler`, and hierarchical, segment-aware imputation with `GroupImputer`. We then added domain-informed feature engineering with `CarFeatureEngineer` to encode depreciation, usage intensity, efficiency/performance ratios, interaction effects, and relative positioning within brand/model segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding and scaling were consolidated in a `ColumnTransformer` combining selective log transforms, `RobustScaler`, one-hot encoding, and median target encoding for high-signal categorical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce noise and improve generalization, we implemented automated feature selection as a dedicated pipeline stage: VarianceThreshold followed by majority voting across complementary selectors (Spearman relevance+redundancy, mutual information, and tree-based importance). SHAP was used strictly for interpretability and diagnostics in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "All model selection and tuning followed a consistent 5-fold cross-validation protocol. Primary evaluation metric MAE was set at the beginning of the project, we also evaluated RMSE and R2. After a first run of different models on original and engineered features, further hyperparameter tuning on the tree-based models HistGradientBoost and RandomForest was decided. The final tuned RF pipeline improved substantially over a naive median baseline (MAE ≈ 6.8k), achieving approximately **£1.3k MAE** in cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed methodological reasoning, trade-offs and further findings please refer to the respective sections."
