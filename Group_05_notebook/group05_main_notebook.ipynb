    "#### Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cars4You project aims to accelerate and standardize used-car price evaluations by replacing manual, subjective pricing with a production-ready machine learning pipeline. Our objective was to optimize predictive accuracy (MAE) on unseen cars while ensuring robustness to wrong inputs and a leakage-free evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our EDA containing univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis showed three dominant challenges: (1) inconsistent raw entries (typos, invalid ranges, sparse categories), (2) strong segmentation effects by brand/model, and (3) heavy-tailed numeric distributions (notably mileage). \n",
    "\n",
    "We addressed these with a custom engineered and reproducible sklearn pipeline. It follows the state of the art pipeline architecture and consists the following transformers: \n",
    "\n",
    "Deterministic cleaning and category canonicalization with `CarDataCleaner` and hierarchical imputation with `IndividualHierarchyImputer`. We then added domain-informed feature engineering with `CarFeatureEngineer` to encode depreciation, usage intensity, efficiency/performance ratios, interaction effects, and relative positioning within brand/model segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding and scaling were consolidated in a `ColumnTransformer` combining selective log transforms, `RobustScaler`, one-hot encoding, mean and median target encoding for categorical structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce noise and improve generalization, we implemented automated feature selection as a dedicated pipeline stage: VarianceThreshold followed by majority voting across complementary selectors (Spearman relevance+redundancy, mutual information, and tree-based importance).\n",
    "\n",
    "All model selection and tuning followed a consistent 5-fold cross-validation protocol. Primary evaluation metric MAE was set at the beginning of the project, we also evaluated RMSE and R2. After a first run of different models on original and engineered features, further hyperparameter tuning on the tree-based models HistGradientBoost and RandomForest was decided. The final tuned pipeline improved substantially over a naive median baseline (MAE ≈ 6.8k), achieving approximately **£1.2k MAE** in cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For detailed methodological reasoning, trade-offs and further findings refer to the respective sections."

    "**Context**       \n",
    "Cars 4 You is an online car-resale company that buys cars from many brands. Sellers submit car details online, and the company traditionally relies on a mechanic inspection before making a purchase offer. Company growth has increased waiting lists for inspections, which risks losing potential customers to competitors. The business need is therefore to **expedite pricing** by generating a reliable **pre-inspection price estimate** directly from user-provided inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main goals**     \n",
    "**Business goal:** provide a fast, consistent price estimate at intake to reduce inspection bottlenecks and improve conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ML goal:** train a supervised **regression** model to predict `price` (GBP) from features available at form submission time. Because `paintQuality%` is filled by a mechanic during evaluation, it is treated as **non-production** input and is excluded from the deployed prediction path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall process (end-to-end)**      \n",
    "1. **Data intake:** use the 2020 training dataset (features + target `price`) to develop and validate models; use the provided test dataset (features only) for final predictions and Kaggle submission.\n",
    "2. **EDA → preprocessing decisions:** identify data inconsistencies, missingness patterns, segmentation by brand/model, and heavy-tailed variables; translate insights into pipeline steps.\n",
    "3. **Leakage-safe pipeline:** implement cleaning, outlier handling, hierarchical imputation, feature engineering, encoding/scaling, and feature selection as sklearn transformers inside a single `Pipeline` so that every step is fitted only on training folds.\n",
    "4. **Model benchmarking & optimization:** compare candidate regressors on a consistent protocol; tune the most promising models; select the most generalizable pipeline based on validation performance.\n",
    "5. **Deployment output:** fit the selected pipeline on the full training set and generate predictions for `test.csv` to produce the final submission `.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model assessment strategy:**     \n",
    "We adopt **5-fold cross-validation (CV)** on the training set as the single assessment strategy used throughout benchmarking and tuning. The primary metric is **MAE** (business-interpretable error in GBP), with RMSE and R² reported as complementary diagnostics. The Kaggle test set functions as an **external holdout** for the final chosen pipeline (labels hidden; performance observed via leaderboard score).\n",

    "- `cat__transmission_Other` and `cat__fuelTypeOther` are filtered by all three voters. This can be explained by the fact that they are redundant as none of the OHE features is dropped during creation to let the FS handle it, which happened succesfully here.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Consequences/Interpretation:**\n",
    "- The similar performance with or without feature selection (small Ablation Study) is due to the few selected features to remove (see Section 8.1.7)\n",

    "- **Common downside:** less data and reduced diversity often outweigh specialization; the global model already captures brand effects via features (including encodings), so restricting to one brand can hurt generalization.\n",

    "Interpretation:\n",
    "- Even with ≥ 80 samples, **pair-level specialization can overfit** and lose beneficial cross-segment learning.\n",
    "- Degradations are often large in both MAE and RMSE, indicating not just noise but materially worse generalization for some pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**e) Alignment with objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This study directly answers whether additional specialization layers are justified for deployment under real data constraints, using the final tuned pipeline `et_tuned_pipe` and a consistent leakage-free CV protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deployment recommendation (based on ExtraTrees results and the observed Δ patterns):**\n",
    "- Keep a **single global model** as the default (most robust across segments).\n",
    "- Consider **brand-level specialization only selectively**, and only where it demonstrates **repeatable negative ΔMAE and/or ΔRMSE** under the same CV protocol.\n",
    "- Consider **brand–model specialization only as a gated option**:\n",
    "  - only for pairs with sufficient data (≥ 80 samples + per-fold minimum training size),\n",
    "  - only if the pair shows **stable negative ΔMAE and not unacceptable ΔRMSE** (watch tail risk),\n",
    "  - and with monitoring, because many pairs **degrade** substantially (positive Δ).\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates not only a tuned final model, but also an evidence-based assessment of whether “more specialized” models actually improve pricing accuracy versus increasing complexity and overfitting risk.\n"

This is probably due to the capability of trees to split on most important characteristics of the cars. Especially, for target encoded features that contain rich information about the price of the car.\n",

If the RF predicts \"Max Value\" but the Linear Model predicts \"Higher Value,\" the Meta-Learner could follow the Linear trend upward.    "
